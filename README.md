# Business Information Systems Middleware Login

## Technical Overview

This application serves as the authentication portal for a middleware business information systems wrapper. It provides a secure login interface that integrates with various business tools and APIs.

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, built using Vite
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + RESTful APIs)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Containerization**: Docker with multi-stage builds
- **Deployment**: Nginx for serving static assets
- **Routing**: React Router v6
- **State Management**: React Context API + Hooks

### Integration Points

This application acts as the gateway to our middleware system that integrates with:
- Xero (accounting)
- SharePoint (document management)
- Monday.com (project management)

## Architecture

### Authentication Flow

1. Users arrive at the login portal
2. Authentication is handled by Supabase Auth
3. After successful authentication:
   - JWT tokens are stored securely
   - User session is maintained in the SupabaseContext
   - User is redirected to the appropriate dashboard

### Data Flow

1. Frontend components make requests through custom hooks
2. Hooks interact with the Supabase client
3. Supabase client handles API communication and caching
4. Responses are transformed and returned to components

### Security Considerations

- Row Level Security (RLS) policies control data access in Supabase
- JWT tokens are used for session management
- Environment variables are used for sensitive configuration
- Authentication state is managed through secure context providers

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Supabase account

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Create `.env.local` with Supabase credentials
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

### Docker Setup

For containerized development:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## Deployment

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This produces optimized assets in the `dist` directory.

### Docker Deployment

The multi-stage Dockerfile optimizes for:
- Dependency caching
- Build optimization
- Minimal production image size

## Testing

Run tests with:

```bash
npm run test
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned API Integrations

1. **Xero Integration**
   - OAuth flow for Xero authentication
   - Financial data synchronization

2. **SharePoint Integration**
   - Microsoft Graph API integration
   - Document retrieval and management

3. **Monday.com Integration**
   - Webhook support for real-time updates
   - Project data synchronization

### Performance Optimizations

- Implement React Suspense for data loading
- Add service worker for offline capabilities
- Set up Lazy loading for route components

### Infrastructure Improvements

- Add CI/CD pipeline
- Implement monitoring and logging
- Set up automatic backups and disaster recovery

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Dependency Management

- Regular updates for security patches
- Compatibility testing before major version upgrades
- Dependency audit during sprint planning

### Code Quality

- ESLint and Prettier for code consistency
- TypeScript for type safety
- Component documentation with Storybook

### Database Management

- Monitor Supabase usage and performance
- Plan for database migrations as schema evolves
- Regular backups of critical data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Issues**
   - Verify Supabase environment variables
   - Check RLS policies
   - Validate JWT token expiration

2. **API Integration Problems**
   - Validate API keys and credentials
   - Check CORS configuration
   - Verify payload formats
